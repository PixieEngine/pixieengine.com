# starting unicorn with bundler, and rvm:

start on filesystem or runlevel [2345]
stop on runlevel [!2345]

chdir /var/www/pixieengine.com/current
env RAILS_ENV=production

# as the unicorn master detaches itself (and you probably want to restart it safely with capistrano), a working solution is to use the pre-start and post-stop flags:

pre-start script

  exec su - rails -c "cd /var/www/pixieengine.com/current; source /usr/local/rvm/scripts/rvm; /usr/local/rvm/bin/rvm-shell -c 'bundle exec unicorn -c config/unicorn.rb -E production -D'"
end script

post-stop exec kill `cat /var/www/pixieengine.com/shared/pids/unicorn.pid`
